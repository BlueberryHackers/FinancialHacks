	<h1>Finance Flash</h1>

	<p>According to Business Insider, "Only 16.4% of U.S. students are required to take a personal finance course to graduate high school." Within the millenial generation, "only 24% of millenials demonstrate	“basic” financial knowledge"." Many high school graduates are entering the workforce with little to no knowledge about personal finance, and are unfit to make good financial decisions in the future. Financial knowledge is only becoming more and more important for the emerging world ahead, and we want to make sure everybody entering the workforce knows the financial concepts not taught in school that are needed for the real world.</p>

	<p>To help solve this problem, we have provided a guide inquiry-based financial simulation quiz. Each quiz question will be followed by an explanation and an introduction to a new financial concept.</p>
